# AOC 2020
My solutions to the Advent of Code 2020 puzzles.

To solve a specific day's problem, run the following command:
```bash
$ aoc2020 <day> (--part <1 or 2>) (--input <INPUT>)
```

`<day` is the number of the day which puzzles you want to solve.

You can pass `--part 1` or `--part 2` to only run a that part of the day's puzzles.

You can also pass in your own input file with the ``--input <FILE>`` option, by default the program uses my input.
